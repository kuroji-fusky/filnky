Flinky is a crowd-sourced curation site about cataloging real, notable, and anthropomorphic characters from all sorts of consumer media, with a clear source trail and proper context—no fan-made knockoffs, no meme animals, and no "THIS MY OC, DON'T STEAL!!!11!" entries.

In short, here's the gist of it:

- ✅ A character should have animalistic/anthropomorphic features
- ✅ Must be tied to a brand or reputable IP and have a decent amount of media presence
  - ✅ Corporate anthro characters are also permissible as along it's not a generic logo
- ❌ It shouldn't be any one else's fursona that's used as their personal avatar
- ❌ It also shouldn't be a modified or recolors from an existing character from a known Franchise
- ❌ Character(s) that are fabricated that may otherwise lead to a conflict of interest

## 1. Characters that are *strictly* show animalistic traits


If a character doesn't show form of verbal communication, it should have some form of sapience or empathy.

### 1a. Anthro-Adjacent Franchises (Pokémon, Digimon, etc.)

### 1b. Characters with Shapeshifting Forms

## 2. Tied to a brand/reputable IP

### 2a. Mascots
### 2b. Fictional characters

## 3. Notability and Metadata

### 3a. Fan-Made and AUs

This pertains to characters that belong to oneself, especially when used as an avatar, this includes:

- **Fursonas**: These are used as a self-expression and do not qualify in section 2a and 2b.
- **Edits of existing characters**: Whether your character is an altered version of *Sonic*, it won't make the cut. 

## Bottom line

Make sure you do your due diligence and verify the character’s existence by doing a background check and to ensure that it’s not fabricated in any way—preferably backed up by its source material and it only takes more than just screenshots, ya dingus.
